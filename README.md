#  𝒞-𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 Compiler Foundations

This project explores the **theoretical and practical application of formal grammars** in building a compiler for the minimalist programming language **𝒞-𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒**. It focuses on lexical and syntactic analysis, intermediate code generation, and the association of grammar rules with semantic actions.

 Developed for the course *Compilers – University of Ioannina* (MΗΥΠ), 2025.

##  Project Focus

- Formal grammars: regular and context-free
- Compiler phases: lexical analysis, parsing, semantic actions
- Foundations for implementing a lexer, parser, and intermediate code generator

---

##  Theoretical Concepts

###  What is a Grammar?
A grammar **G = (N, Σ, R, S)** defines the syntactically valid strings of a language, with:
- `N`: non-terminal symbols
- `Σ`: terminal symbols
- `R`: production rules (A → α)
- `S`: start symbol

##  Project Contents

###  Chapter 1 – Grammar Foundations
- Categories of grammars (regular, context-free)
- Compiler phases mapped to grammar types
- Visualized compiler pipeline (Figure 1.1)

###  Chapter 2 – 𝒞-𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 Grammar
- Full formal grammar specification of 𝒞-𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒
- LL(1) / LR(1) compatibility checks
- Rule listing: `A → α` productions

###  Chapter 3 – Syntax-Directed Translation
- Mapping actions to productions
- Intermediate code generation
- Design of syntax-directed translation schema

---

##  Learning Goals

- ✔ Understand how grammars relate to compiler phases  
- ✔ Design and analyze LL/LR grammars  
- ✔ Apply semantic actions to generate code  
- ✔ Prepare for practical implementation with tools like **flex/bison**, **lex/yacc**, or **ANTLR**

---

##  Next Steps

- Define lexical tokens for 𝒞-𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒
- Implement lexer and parser (e.g., with ANTLR or Flex/Bison)
- Add semantic checks and intermediate representation
- Extend toward code generation for a virtual machine or backend
